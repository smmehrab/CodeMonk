<h3 align="center">CodeMonk - Discord Bot</h3>
<br />

<bold>A Discord Bot for Small Competitive Programming Communities</bold> so that they may keep track of their ratings, solve, submissions etc and also manage the shared problems in a more easy and convenient manner.

It's inspired from another discord bot named [TLE](https://github.com/cheran-senthil/TLE), which I was originally trying to install on our server of a small group of improving problem solvers. Somehow, silly me, found it hard to install that bot, as my app was showing some error. But I loved their work and thought I can make one of my own too, based on my own needs.

Hope, I will keep improving this bot as I climb up the ladders of learning problem solving skills in the coming future.
